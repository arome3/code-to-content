# Quick Twitter Thread Generation

Generate a Twitter/X thread quickly when you already have your topic and know your audience.

**Quick Mode:** Skips Phase 1 (Project Analysis), Phase 2 (Audience Declaration), and Phase 4 (Optimization).

## When to Use Quick Mode

- You already know your audience (assumes intermediate developers)
- Topic is clear and doesn't require codebase analysis
- Time-sensitive content needed fast
- Iterating on existing content

## Process

1. **Load Format Reference**
   Read: `skills/code-to-content/references/formats.md` (twitter section)

2. **Generate Thread**
   Create 5-12 tweets following this structure:

   **Tweet 1 (Hook):** Most important - creates curiosity or challenges assumption
   **Tweets 2-3:** Context and problem setup
   **Tweets 4-7:** Core insight with examples
   **Tweets 8-10:** Solution or takeaway
   **Final Tweet:** CTA (link, follow request, engagement question)

3. **Quick Validation**
   - [ ] Each tweet < 280 characters
   - [ ] Hook creates curiosity (not generic)
   - [ ] Each tweet has standalone value
   - [ ] CTA at the end

4. **Deliver**
   Present with:
   - Copy-ready format with `---COPY BELOW---` markers
   - Character count per tweet
   - Image suggestions for key tweets
   - Best posting time suggestion
