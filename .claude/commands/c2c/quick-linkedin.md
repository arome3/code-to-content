# Quick LinkedIn Post Generation

Generate a LinkedIn post quickly when you already have your topic and know your audience.

**Quick Mode:** Skips Phase 1 (Project Analysis), Phase 2 (Audience Declaration), and Phase 4 (Optimization).

## When to Use Quick Mode

- You already know your audience (assumes intermediate developers)
- Topic is clear and doesn't require codebase analysis
- Time-sensitive content needed fast
- Iterating on existing content

## Process

1. **Load Format Reference**
   Read: `skills/code-to-content/references/formats.md` (linkedin section)

2. **Generate Post**
   Structure:

   **Lines 1-2 (Hook):** Visible before "see more" - must create curiosity
   **Lines 3-6:** Personal story with specific details
   **Bullet Points:** 3 actionable takeaways
   **Final Line:** Engagement question

   Target: 800-1300 characters

3. **Quick Validation**
   - [ ] Hook in first 2 lines creates curiosity
   - [ ] Specific details (numbers, names, dates)
   - [ ] Clear takeaways as bullet points
   - [ ] Engagement question at end
   - [ ] 800-1300 characters
   - [ ] No external links in body (algorithm penalty)

4. **Deliver**
   Present with:
   - Copy-ready format
   - Character count
   - 5 relevant hashtags
   - Best posting time suggestion
