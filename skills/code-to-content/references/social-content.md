# Social Content Generation

Instructions for generating Twitter/X threads, LinkedIn posts, and other social content from the user's technical project.

---

## Platform Selection

When the user requests social content, determine the appropriate platform:

| Platform | When to Use | Tone | Constraints |
|----------|-------------|------|-------------|
| Twitter/X | Quick insights, announcements, engagement | Casual, punchy | 280 chars/tweet, 8-15 tweets per thread |
| LinkedIn | Career narratives, business impact, thought leadership | Professional, story-driven | 1300-3000 chars total |
| Dev.to/Hashnode | Tutorial snippets, announcements | Technical, detailed | Medium-length posts |
| Reddit | Discussion prompts, feedback requests | Authentic, no self-promotion | Variable length |

# Twitter/X Thread Generation

## Thread Structure

Generate threads following this anatomy:

```
TWEET 1: HOOK
- Stop the scroll with surprising fact, result, or question
- Promise value immediately
- Never use "thread incoming" or similar preamble

TWEETS 2-N: BODY
- One idea per tweet
- Use line breaks for visual breathing room
- Each tweet should be comprehensible standalone
- Include placeholder notes for code screenshots where relevant

FINAL TWEET: CTA
- Summarize the key takeaway
- Include call to action (question, link, follow request)
- Link to full resource if available
```

## Extracting Hooks from the Project

Scan the user's project and conversation history to identify hook material:

1. **Surprising metrics**: Performance improvements, cost savings, time reductions
2. **Contrarian decisions**: Technologies NOT used, patterns rejected, conventional wisdom ignored
3. **Concrete results**: Before/after comparisons, measurable outcomes
4. **Story moments**: Bugs found, problems solved, lessons learned
5. **Curiosity gaps**: Unusual approaches, unexpected solutions

## Hook Formulas

### The Surprising Statement
```
[Unexpected action or result]

[Positive outcome 1]
[Positive outcome 2]
[Positive outcome 3]

Here's what I learned:
```

### The Contrarian Take
```
Hot take: [Challenge conventional wisdom]

I've been [credential]. Here are [N] "[practice]"
I've stopped following (and what I do instead):
```

### The Results-First Hook
```
We [achieved specific result].

No [expected approach].
No [expected approach].
Just [simple explanation].

Here's exactly what we changed:
```

### The Story Hook
```
[Dramatic consequence with specific number]

Here's the [problem], how we found it, and the [solution]
that could've prevented it.
```

### The Curiosity Gap
```
The most useful [concept] isn't:

- [Expected thing]
- [Expected thing]
- [Expected thing]

It's something [surprising contrast].

Let me explain:
```

## Body Tweet Patterns

### Numbered List Pattern
```
[N]/ [Topic]

[Specific detail from project]

[Technique or approach used]

Result: [Concrete metric]
```

### Before/After Pattern
```
Before:
- [Old state metric 1]
- [Old state metric 2]
- [Old state metric 3]

After:
- [New state metric 1]
- [New state metric 2]
- [New state metric 3]

Here's how we [achieved this]:
```

### Code Insight Pattern
```
The fix was [emotion/assessment].

[Note: Code screenshot showing before/after]

[Simple explanation].

But finding this took [effort]. Here's how:
```

### Key Insight Pattern
```
The key insight:

[Reframed understanding of concept]

Once we thought about it this way, [outcome].
```

## Thread Length Guidelines

Match thread length to content depth:

| Content Type | Target Length |
|--------------|---------------|
| Quick tip | 3-5 tweets |
| Story/lesson | 7-10 tweets |
| Tutorial/guide | 10-15 tweets |
| Deep dive | 15-20 tweets |

Prefer shorter threads. Respect reader attention.

## CTA Tweet Patterns

### Resource Link CTA
```
TL;DR:
1. [Takeaway 1]
2. [Takeaway 2]
3. [Takeaway 3]

Full technical writeup with code samples:
[link placeholder]

If this helped, RT tweet 1 to help others find it!
```

### Question Ending CTA
```
That's what worked for us.

But I'm curious—what's YOUR [related approach]?

Reply with your [specific ask]
```

### Follow CTA
```
I share breakdowns like this [frequency].

Follow @[handle placeholder] for more [content type].

And if you found this useful, RT to spread the knowledge!
```

## Thread Generation Template

When generating a Twitter thread, follow this structure:

```
1/ [HOOK - Use formula above, extract from project data]

2/ [CONTEXT - 1-2 sentences of background from project]

3/ [PROBLEM - The challenge the project addressed]

4/ [INITIAL APPROACH - What was tried first or what's common]

5/ [TWIST - Why that didn't work or what changed]

6/ [INSIGHT - The realization that led to the solution]

7/ [SOLUTION - What the project actually does, with visual note]

8/ [RESULT - Concrete numbers from the project]

9/ [TAKEAWAY - Generalized lesson for readers]

10/ [CTA - Engagement request with link placeholder]
```

# LinkedIn Post Generation

## Post Structure

Generate LinkedIn posts following this anatomy:

```
HOOK (First 2 lines - visible before "See more")
- First line must compel the click
- Use line break after hook for visual impact
- This determines whether anyone reads further

STORY (Body - 3-4 paragraphs)
- Set the scene with specific situation
- Present the challenge or conflict
- Describe the decision or action taken
- Show the outcome with specifics

LESSON (Takeaway section)
- Generalize what was learned
- Make it applicable to readers
- Use bullet points for scannability

CTA (Engagement close)
- Ask a genuine question
- Invite discussion
- Include 3-5 relevant hashtags
```

## Extracting LinkedIn Angles from the Project

Identify the most compelling angle for LinkedIn's professional audience:

| Angle | Extract From Project |
|-------|---------------------|
| Career growth | Skills developed, problems solved at scale |
| Technical decision | Architecture choices, technology selection rationale |
| Leadership lesson | Team collaboration, mentoring moments, conflicts resolved |
| Build in public | Progress updates, milestones reached, challenges faced |
| Failure story | Bugs encountered, mistakes made, recovery process |
| Industry insight | Patterns observed, conventional wisdom challenged |

## LinkedIn Hook Formulas

### The Confession
```
I [surprising action].

[Stakeholder reaction].

Here's why I did it anyway:
```

### The Lesson Learned
```
The best [type of decision] I made this year?

[Counterintuitive choice].

Let me explain:
```

### The Career Moment
```
[Time ago], I [action from project].

Today, [positive outcome].

Here's the story:
```

### The Counterintuitive Insight
```
The worst advice I got as a [role]:

"[Common advice]."

Here's what I wish someone told me instead:
```

### The Numbers Hook
```
[Impressive metric from project].

We didn't [expected approach].
We didn't [expected approach].
We changed one thing:
```

## LinkedIn Post Generation Template

```
[HOOK - 1-2 lines using formula above]

[LINE BREAK]

[STORY PARAGRAPH 1 - Specific situation from project]

[STORY PARAGRAPH 2 - The challenge or conflict encountered]

[STORY PARAGRAPH 3 - Decision made or action taken]

[STORY PARAGRAPH 4 - Outcome with specific details]

[LINE BREAK]

The lesson I learned:

- [Insight 1 generalized from project]
- [Insight 2 generalized from project]
- [Insight 3 generalized from project]

[LINE BREAK]

What's your experience with [topic]?

# Code Visuals for Social Content

When social posts include code examples, generate shareable code images.

**See:** `references/code-snippets.md` for complete instructions.

## Quick Platform Guidelines

| Platform | Tool | Theme | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Twitter | Carbon | dracula, synthwave-84 | High contrast for dark feeds |
| LinkedIn | Carbon | one-dark, night-owl | Professional appearance |

## When to Include Code Images

- **Twitter threads**: Include for key insight tweets, max 10 lines per image
- **LinkedIn posts**: Optional, mention "swipe for code" or add Carbon link in comments
- **Announcements**: Hero code image showcasing main feature

## Quick Generation

```
1. Extract relevant code snippet (5-15 lines ideal)
2. Generate Carbon URL with platform-appropriate theme
3. Add note: "[Code screenshot placeholder: Carbon link above]"
4. User can click link → Export PNG → Attach to post
```
