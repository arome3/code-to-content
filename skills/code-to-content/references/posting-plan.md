# Posting Plan Generation Instructions

Implementation guide for generating multi-day content schedules with ready-to-post content for each day.

---

## When to Use

Generate a posting plan when the user:
- Is launching a project and wants coordinated content
- Wants to maximize reach across platforms over time
- Needs a content calendar for consistent posting
- Wants to repurpose one project into multiple posts

---

## Pre-Generation: Content Inventory

Before generating a posting plan, extract available content angles:

```
FROM PROJECT ANALYSIS, IDENTIFY:
├── Core announcement / main story
├── Technical deep-dives (2-3 aspects)
├── Behind-the-scenes moments
├── Lessons learned / insights
├── Use cases / examples
├── Metrics / results
├── Origin story
├── Future vision
└── Community / gratitude angles
```

Each angle becomes a potential post in the schedule.
