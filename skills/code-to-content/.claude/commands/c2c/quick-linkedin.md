## Mode: QUICK (Reduced Verification)

- Tone: Personal story + actionable insight

---

## Content Generation

Generate a post (800-1300 characters) with this structure:

### Hook (CRITICAL)
First 2 lines appear before "see more" — make them count:
- Start with a bold statement, result, or question
- Create reason to click "see more"

### Story (3-4 short paragraphs)
- Specific situation (name the project, date, context)
- Challenge you faced
- What you learned or discovered

### Takeaways (3 bullets)
- Actionable lessons others can apply
- Start each with a verb

### Engagement
- End with a question that invites responses
- Keep it open-ended, not yes/no

---

Before delivery, verify:
- [ ] Hook appears in first 2 lines
- [ ] Story is personal and specific (not generic advice)
- [ ] 3 actionable takeaways present
- [ ] Engagement question at end
- [ ] No corporate jargon
